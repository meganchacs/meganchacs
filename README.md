- 👋 Hi, I’m @meganchacs
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development
- 🌱 I just finished Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, and more.
- 🧰 In my most recently project, I built a full CRUD app using MongoDB, Express, and Node.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on projects, join a hackathon, and exchange ideas and solutions with other devs.
